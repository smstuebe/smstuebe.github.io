Calligraphy is a nice library that provides custom font handling in Android. I once had issues with the MvvmCross layout inflation and knew that using Calligraphy with MvvmCross will cause some problems and I pushed it onto my Blog todo list - but I was lazy. But this week I saw <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42105583/callygraphyxamarin-not-working-in-mvxappcompatactivity" target="_blank" onclick="return tol(this);">a question on stackoverflow</a>.

<h2 class="section-heading">TL;DR</h2>
If you just want to get Calligraphy working.

    Install-Package MvvmCross.Calligraphy
	
and modify your Setup.cs

{% highlight c# %}
public class Setup : MvxAndroidSetup
{
    protected override MvxAndroidBindingBuilder CreateBindingBuilder()
    {
        return new CalligraphyMvxAndroidBindingBuilder();
    }
} 
{% endhighlight %}

done. You **don't** need to override `AttachBaseContext`. And you can setup calligraphy via `CalligraphyConfig.InitDefault` as documented.


<h2 class="section-heading">Problem</h2>

MvvmCross and Calligraphy are using the same approach for two different things. MvvmCross uses a custom LayoutInflater to provide xml based data binding and Calligraphy uses a custom LayoutInflater that sets the font to TextViews at inflation time. And if you use MvvmCross, the MvvmCross inflater wins.

<h2 class="section-heading">Why not use Calligraphy Xamarin?</h2>

There is already the NuGet package / Xamarin component called <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/effects/creating/" target="_blank" onclick="return tol(this);">Calligraphy Xamarin</a>. But it doesn't offer the non public class `CalligraphyFactory` that you need for the fix. If you install it and follow the setup instructions, you will notice, that it won't have any effect.


<h2 class="section-heading">How does it work?</h2>

The package provides a custom `MvxAndroidViewBinder` called `CalligraphyMvxAndroidViewBinder` that applies calligraphy changes for every layout that is inflated with `BindingInflate` (which should be basically every view). All what's left, is to put the pieces together. Use `CalligraphyMvxAndroidViewFactory` to construct it and `CalligraphyMvxAndroidBindingBuilder` to return the factory in `CreateAndroidViewBinderFactory()`. In your code you only have to return a new `CalligraphyMvxAndroidBindingBuilder` in your Setup's `CreateBindingBuilder()` method.  

{% highlight c# %}
public class Setup : MvxAndroidSetup
{
    protected override MvxAndroidBindingBuilder CreateBindingBuilder()
    {
        return new CalligraphyMvxAndroidBindingBuilder();
    }
} 
{% endhighlight %}

<h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

There is a nice side effect, using the factory directly. You don't have to wrap every context (Activity, Fragment) with the `CalligraphyContextWrapper`, because the binding inflater is used globally :) Yay! <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/MvvmCross.Calligraphy/" target="_blank" onclick="return tol(this);">MvvmCross.Calligraphy on NuGet</a>

<b>Code</b>

The code is available on github <i class="fa fa-github"></i><a href="https://github.com/smstuebe/mvvmcross-calligraphy" target="_blank" onclick="return tol(this);">mvvmcross-calligraphy</a>. It includes a sample project, too.
